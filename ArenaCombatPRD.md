**Product Requirements Document (PRD) â€“ Arena Combat Game MVP**

**Overview**
This project is a fast-paced arena combat game inspired by *World of Warcraft* and *League of Legends*, focusing on smooth movement, iterative animation improvements, and engaging combat mechanics. The game will be built using *Three.js*, starting with simple primitive-based models and iterating toward rigged *GLTF* assets.

**Objectives**
- Establish a responsive *WASD* movement system with third-person camera controls (drag/orbit functionality).
- Implement a basic combat system featuring melee attacks.
- Provide a training dummy NPC for testing attacks and damage interactions.
- Lay the groundwork for targeting mechanics (tab-select and mouse click targeting) in future updates.
- Ensure the game is visually and mechanically improvable through iterative updates, with a focus on better animations and asset refinement.

**Core Features (MVP)**
1. **Movement & Camera**
   - WASD-based movement.
   - Third-person camera that follows the player and can be rotated/orbited.

2. **Combat System**
   - Basic melee attack ability.
   - Simple hit detection and damage application.
   - Training dummy NPC that can receive attacks.

3. **Graphics & Animation**
   - Initial character and environment modeled with *Three.js* primitives.
   - Placeholder animations (e.g., attack swings, idle stance).
   - Future iterations will improve animation quality, transitioning to rigged *GLTF* assets.

**Future Iterations**
- Add targeting mechanics via tab-selection and click targeting.
- Expand abilities beyond melee (e.g., ranged attacks, spells).
- Improve character animations with more polished assets and motion blending.
- Introduce additional NPCs and interactive elements for testing.

**Development Approach**
This project will follow a *vibe coding* methodology, leveraging LLM-assisted iteration. The priority is rapid prototyping, continuous visual improvements, and ensuring smooth character movement and combat feel from the start. Early testing and feedback will drive refinements.

**Success Criteria**
- Functional *WASD* movement and smooth third-person camera.
- Basic combat system with a melee attack.
- Working training dummy NPC that takes damage.
- Clear path for iterative graphics and animation improvements.

This MVP will serve as a testbed for gameplay mechanics and graphical enhancements, ensuring a scalable foundation for further development.
